# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a coding language developed by Linus Torvald that permits the sharing of code more efficiently. Github is an online web tool that acts as a remote repository for various code projects. Github makes use of the git code language to enable the transfer of various code projects back and forth between local and remote repositories. Github provides a stable and secure place for code to be stored and shared.

Researched answer: Git is a software tool that is locally stored on computers and provides a tracking history of source code, also known as as a version control system, while Github is an online service that acts as a remote repository.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: &&, ||, and ! are one type, while >,<,<=, >=, are another, and == and === are the third type.

Researched answer: There are three categories of operators that produce Boolean values. Those three categories are: Equality Operators, Logical Operators, and Relational Operators. Equality operators follow two types--loose and strict designated by == and ===. Loose operators will convert the data types to the same type before determing whether the statement is true/false. Strict operators require the data types to be the same to operate without error. Logical operators, designated by &&, ||, and !  represent and, or, and not logic. Finally, Relational operators look for relationships between values and use greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to operators to produce Boolean values.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the location data types are placed and a value is what is produced by the data type being called upon.

Researched answer: An index is the position of a value in an array. The value is the content or specific element in an array. For example in the array ["Torin", "Christopher", "Jacobs"], the values are Torin, Christopher, and Jacobs, but the index of those values are 0, 1, and 2 denoting the position of the value in the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are sets of values that can combine different data types. Strings are sets of values that are specific data types of letters, numbers and symbols that are contained within quotation marks. A common example of a string is a word, as long as it has quotation marks around it.

Researched answer: Arrays are variables that contain a list of items. They are organized in an index so that data can be reliably called upon from within that list/index. String are one of the primitive data types in Javascript that contain a set(s) of characters within quotation marks, for example "bluebird" is a string because it is contained within the quotation marks. Arrays and strings share similarities such as the ability to combine multiple arrays together, or multiple strings with one another via corresponding built-in commands. A difference between arrays and strings is that arrays can combine multiple data types within the set, whereas strings can only contain string data types.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques involve two people working together in specific roles on coding projects. The driver follows the directions of the navigator and types in the code that the navigator communicates verbally. The navigator assists the driver by reviewing the code being typed and doing any necessary research to provide solutions.

Researched answer: Two people working on one code source to collaboratively create one program. The driver is typing/writing and listening to the navigator while focusing on the immediate tast. The navigator guides the driver, researches, and reviews the code as it's being typed. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions within a function that can also produce a function. A variable may be made into a function and passed on into the parameters of a different function, thereby increasing the efficiency/functionality of the code.

2. Jest: a testing platform within Javascript to determine if the code is operating correctly.

3. Objects: the key:value pair datatype within Javascript that combines symbol data types refered to as key, and any other valid data type which is the value.

4. Method: A function with an object.

5. Classes: functions that help with the design of objects.
